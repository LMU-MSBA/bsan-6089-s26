- **Milestone 3**: Refinement/presentation phase

### 3. Provide Clear Deliverables
Each milestone should specify:
- What students must submit
- Format and length requirements
- Evaluation criteria
- Due dates

### 4. Support Student Success

- Office hours and support options

## Integration with Dataset Generator GPT

Project requirements can be used as context for the Dataset Generator GPT to create practice datasets that match your course's specific scenarios and requirements.

See `/gpts/dataset-generator/` for GPT configuration details.
